------------------------How to run:------------------------
Run "mw2Installer.bat"

------------------------What does it do:------------------------
It runs the PowerShell script. 
(Don't ask me why Microsoft decided to lock PowerShell scripts by default, but not the batch files and then made it trivial to bypass the security. I don't make the rules)

------------------------The script does the following:------------------------
1) Tries to find your MechWarrior 2 CD
2) Installs it in <Drive>\<folder you chose>\MechWarrior 2 - <game name>
	eg: C:\Games\MechWarrior 2 - 31st Centrury Combat
3) Copies the relevant DxWnd files, dgVoodoo2 files, and profiles created by BEEN_Nath_58 that make it work, and work with a nice looking emulated 3Dfx Voodoo graphics.       
5) Creates a desktop shortcut which you can then move (or not), but otherwise run as you like.
6) Bundles _farPatcher.exe (W95) and Titanfarpatcher.exe (Titanium) - but you will have to run it yourself

******************************** NOTE ********************************
Due to engine limitations, if your frame rate is above 50, the jumpjets won't recharge. 
It has been set to the maximum at 50FPS.
